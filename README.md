PCB for multisync switch for atari as described here: http://info-coach.fr/atari/hardware/interfaces.php#multisync_switch


Note: mk3 is as of now (2016-10-10) has only been tested on breadboard, no promises. And the SMD version has the wrong partnumber for the analogue switch (doesn't matter really, same pins), it should be a CD4053.
